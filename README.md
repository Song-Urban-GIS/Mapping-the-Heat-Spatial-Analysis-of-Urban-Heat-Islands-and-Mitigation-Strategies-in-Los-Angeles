# Mapping the Heat: Spatial Analysis of Urban Heat Islands and Mitigation Strategies in Los Angeles

GIS-based investigation into Urban Heat Island (UHI) intensity in LA County. 
This project correlates Land Surface Temperature (LST) with tree canopy coverage and socioeconomic vulnerability to propose targeted, data-driven urban cooling interventions.

## 📖 Project Background

Los Angeles is one of the most heat-vulnerable cities in the U.S.
This project leverages ArcGIS Pro to analyze the spatial distribution of Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) and their relationship with urban infrastructure and social equity.


## 🎯 Key Objectives

 **Identify Hotspots:** Pinpoint areas experiencing significantly higher surface temperatures ($5-10^{\circ}F$ above average) using Landsat Surface Temperature data from NASA.
 
 **Correlation Study:** Analyze the inverse relationship between tree canopy coverage and UHI intensity.
 
 **Equity Analysis:** Overlap heat maps with socioeconomic data to identify vulnerable populations.

 **Suitability Mapping:** Propose optimal locations for tree planting and cooling centers.
