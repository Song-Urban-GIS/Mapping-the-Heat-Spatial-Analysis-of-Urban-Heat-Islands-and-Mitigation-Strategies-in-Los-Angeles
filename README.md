# Mapping the Heat: Spatial Analysis of Urban Heat Islands and Mitigation Strategies in Los Angeles
GIS-based investigation into Urban Heat Island (UHI) intensity in LA County. This project correlates Land Surface Temperature (LST) with tree canopy coverage and socioeconomic vulnerability to propose targeted, data-driven urban cooling interventions.

## 📖 Project Background
Los Angeles is one of the most heat-vulnerable cities in the U.S. [cite: 255] [cite_start]This project leverages ArcGIS Pro to analyze the spatial distribution of Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) and their relationship with urban infrastructure and social equity.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
* [cite_start]**Identify Hotspots:** Pinpoint areas experiencing significantly higher surface temperatures ($5-10^{\circ}F$ above average) using NASA Landsat 8/9 data. [cite: 305, 309, 399]
* [cite_start]**Correlation Study:** Analyze the inverse relationship between tree canopy coverage and UHI intensity. [cite: 367, 404]
* [cite_start]**Equity Analysis:** Overlap heat maps with socioeconomic data to identify vulnerable populations. [cite: 360, 410]
* [cite_start]**Suitability Mapping:** Propose optimal locations for tree planting and cooling centers. [cite: 369, 371, 417]
